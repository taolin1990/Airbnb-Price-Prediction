# Airbnb-Price-Prediction
use Machine Learning and NLP technology to build a model to predict the price based on what hosts can offer.
Airbnb is widely used for booking short-term or even long-term rentals wherever customers
need it.
In reality, most customers choose their Airbnb places mainly based on the locations and price.
I came up with this machine learning model to not only help hosts to list their rentals at a
reasonable price but also provide guidelines for Airbnb to check any listings price outliers.
Datasets:
The dataset is about 2019 Toronto Airbnb Listings Information which was collected from an
open-scored organization insideairbnb.com (The data behind the Inside Airbnb site is sourced
from publicly available information from the Airbnb API.)
